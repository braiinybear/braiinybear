              BraiinyBear promotes animal husbandry not only as a livelihood option but as a sustainable
              community development tool. It trains rural families in modern livestock management, covering
              areas such as nutrition, breeding techniques, shelter management, and disease control.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Society frequently partners with veterinary professionals to conduct animal health camps,
              vaccination drives, and awareness sessions on zoonotic diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also supports women-led dairy cooperatives and backyard poultry farming units, enabling
              supplemental income and nutritional security for families.
            </p>
            <p>
              All initiatives are driven by a strong emphasis on ethical treatment, animal welfare, and
              eco-friendly practices.
